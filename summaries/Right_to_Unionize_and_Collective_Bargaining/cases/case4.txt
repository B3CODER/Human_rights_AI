The Bombay High Court decision in the case of Medical Superintendent Rural ... vs Rajashree Lakshman Yadav on 26 June 2024 addresses several key issues related to the employment and permanency of temporary workers. Here’s a summary of the judgment:

Background
Parties Involved: The case involves the Medical Superintendents/Civil Surgeons of various hospitals and the Deputy Director of Health Services, Pune, challenging the common judgment of the Industrial Court, Satara.
Nature of Complaint: The complaints were filed by temporary employees (Respondents) alleging unfair labor practices regarding their temporary appointments in different hospitals. The Industrial Court had previously ordered their continuation and the grant of permanency.
Facts
Temporary Appointments: The State Government set up hospitals where temporary appointments were made to fill vacant posts due to various reasons. The Respondents were appointed for three months with intermittent breaks of one day after every 29 days.
Complaints: When the temporary appointments ended, the Respondents filed complaints before the Industrial Court seeking continuation and permanency.
Issues
Unfair Labor Practices: The main issue was whether the temporary employees were entitled to permanency despite their appointments being initially made for short durations and without a formal selection process.
Industrial Court's Findings: The Industrial Court had directed the continuation of employment and the benefit of permanency based on the Respondents having completed 240 days of service.
High Court’s Judgment
Error in Industrial Court's Judgment: The High Court found that the Industrial Court erred in granting permanency. The court noted that the appointments were temporary and that the respondents had not undergone any formal selection process. The mere completion of 240 days of service did not automatically entitle the employees to permanency.
Legal Precedents: The High Court referenced the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Umadevi and other related cases to argue that temporary employees without a proper selection process could not claim permanency.
Decision: The High Court set aside the Industrial Court’s judgment, dismissing the complaints filed by the Respondents. The writ petitions were allowed, and there were no orders as to costs.
Conclusion
The Bombay High Court concluded that the Industrial Court's directions to grant permanency to the temporary employees were unjustified given the temporary nature of their appointments and the lack of a formal selection process.
