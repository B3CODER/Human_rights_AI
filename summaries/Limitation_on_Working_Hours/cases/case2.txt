In the case Man Kunwar vs Delhi Building And Other Construction Workers Board decided on 14 August 2024 by the Delhi High Court, the key points are:

Petition Overview:

The petition was filed by Man Kunwar seeking directions to restore the registration of her deceased husband under the Building and Other Construction Workers Act, 1996 (BOCW Act). This was necessary to process his pension application.
She also requested penal interest on pension arrears and the release of family pension as per the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Rules, 2002.
Background:

The petitioner’s husband was registered under the BOCW Act and made contributions until 23 April 2018.
Due to staffing shortages at the Board, his registration was not renewed, which led to issues with his pension.
The husband filed for restoration of his registration on 8 April 2021, but the application was not processed before his death on 8 September 2021.
Court Findings:

The Court acknowledged that the non-renewal of registration was due to circumstances beyond the petitioner’s control and the shortage of staff at the Board.
It was noted that the intent of the BOCW Act is to provide benefits, and past judgments supported the continuity of benefits beyond the one-year registration period.
Order:

The Court directed that the petitioner should deposit the arrears in contribution within two weeks. Following this, the Board was to renew the registration within four weeks.
No penal interest was granted due to the lapse in registration.
The petition was disposed of with these directions.
Judge Tara Vitasta Ganj concluded the order, emphasizing the intent of the legislation and the circumstances that led to the delay in processing the benefits.
