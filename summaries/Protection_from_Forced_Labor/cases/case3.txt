Case Details
Date of Judgment: 11 July 2024
Court: Madras High Court
Case Numbers: C.M.A.Nos.1813, 2020 and 2042 of 2021
Appellant: Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESI Corporation)
Respondent: Bala Tourist Service
Background
The appeals are filed by the ESI Corporation challenging orders passed by the ESI Court in three different proceedings related to the payment of contributions under the Employees' State Insurance Act (ESI Act) for various periods.

Issues
Employer-Employee Relationship: Whether the engagement of owner-cum-drivers by the respondent Establishment creates an employer-employee relationship under the ESI Act.
Payment of Contributions: Whether car hire charges paid to these owner-cum-drivers should be considered as wages for the purpose of ESI contributions.
Facts
Respondent Establishment: Bala Tourist Service, operating tourist vehicles on hire with 35 employees.
Dispute: ESI Corporation issued notices to the Establishment for contributions for three different periods, claiming that payments to owner-cum-drivers should be covered under the ESI Act.
Establishment's Argument: The Establishment contends that the owner-cum-drivers are independent operators who provide services directly to the customers and are not under their control or supervision. Payments to these operators are categorized as car hire charges, not wages.
Court's Findings
Employer-Employee Relationship: The Court found that the owner-cum-drivers were not employees under the ESI Act. They operate independently and have their own vehicles, implying no direct control or supervisory relationship with the Establishment.
Contribution Validity: Payments made to owner-cum-drivers classified as car hire charges should be included in the ESI contributions.
Judgment
Appeals Allowed: The Court set aside the ESI Court's orders and upheld the ESI Corporation's orders.
Direction: The Establishment was directed to remit the contribution as fixed by the ESI Corporation within six weeks of receiving the judgment copy.
Costs: No costs were awarded.
Key Points
The Court clarified that owner-cum-drivers are not covered under the ESI Act due to the nature of their engagement.
The classification of payments as car hire charges and their treatment in the context of ESI contributions were affirmed.
Conclusion
The Madras High Court's decision mandates the Establishment to pay ESI contributions based on the Corporation's assessment and reaffirms the validity of the Corporation's orders.
