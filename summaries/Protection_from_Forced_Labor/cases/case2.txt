Facts:
Petitioner’s Background: The petitioner was appointed as a Junior Assistant-Cum-Typist at Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. and was subsequently promoted through various positions, eventually reaching the role of Personal Officer. He worked with the board for over 38 years and was categorized as a Class II employee.

Issue of Authority: The petitioner was not authorized to make independent decisions or handle significant administrative functions. His responsibilities required prior approval from higher authorities, reflecting his Class II status.

Legal Dispute: The petitioner filed a reference with the Labour Court claiming entitlement to arrears of salary and benefits from the date of termination until the date of superannuation, based on the contention that he was wrongly categorized or treated in terms of employment benefits.

Previous Court Decisions: The Labour Court had rejected the petitioner's claims, which led to the present petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.

Issues:
Classification as a Workman: Whether the petitioner falls under the category of "workman" as defined by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which would affect his entitlement to relief under the Act.

Impugned Order and Arrears: Whether the order dated 07.02.2006 by the Labour Court was erroneous in rejecting the petitioner’s claim for arrears and other benefits.

Precedents and Binding Judgments: Whether existing precedents and judgments influence the current petition and the interpretation of statutory provisions.

Conclusion:
Legal Status: The court upheld the Industrial Tribunal’s decision that officers in the cadre of Executive Engineer and Deputy Engineer with the Gujarat Electricity Board are not considered "workmen" under the Industrial Disputes Act. Consequently, the Labour Court's previous decisions on similar issues were deemed correct.

Dismissal of Petition: The petition was dismissed as the court found no error in the Industrial Tribunal’s award or the Labour Court's handling of the case. The request for arrears and other benefits was not granted.

Interim Relief: Any interim relief previously granted was vacated, and the petition was dismissed without costs.

Future Guidance: The court directed the Registry to send copies of the judgment to relevant industrial tribunals and labour courts for circulation.

In summary, the Gujarat High Court’s decision reaffirmed that the petitioner’s classification and entitlement to benefits were appropriately handled under existing laws and precedents. The petition was dismissed based on the court's adherence to established legal interpretations and the absence of errors in prior decisions.
