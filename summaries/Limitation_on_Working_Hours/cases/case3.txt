Facts of the Case
Incident: On 07 November 2012, ASI Jagir Singh observed a dead body of a young male at Gali No.1, Meet Nagar, Delhi. The body had multiple stab wounds and was found in a pool of blood. The incident was reported, and an FIR was registered under Section 302 IPC (murder).

Investigation: The crime scene was examined, and evidence was collected. The deceased was identified as Raju (s/o Bhoore Khan). Postmortem revealed 29 external ante-mortem injuries and the cause of death was hemorrhagic shock due to sharp-edged weapon injuries.

Charges: The accused, Ashraf, Shahnawz @ Hebert, and Nadeem Ahmed @ Sher Khan, were charged with offences under Sections 302, 365, 120-B, and 34 IPC, and Section 27 of the Arms Act. They were alleged to have abducted and murdered Raju using knives.

Evidence: Several witnesses were declared hostile, and their testimonies did not support the prosecutionâ€™s case. Key evidence included photographs of the crime scene, postmortem reports, and recovery of items allegedly related to the crime.

Legal Provisions
Section 27 of the Arms Act: Imposes penalties for the use of arms or ammunition in contravention of the law.

Evidence Requirements: Prosecution must prove the connection of the accused with the crime through concrete evidence, including the identification of items used in the crime.

Decision
The court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused due to insufficient evidence linking them to the crime. Specifically, the evidence did not establish a clear connection between the accused and the blood-stained clothes or weapons. Therefore, all accused persons, including Ashraf, were acquitted of all charges.

Conclusion
The court found that the prosecution did not provide enough evidence to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, the accused were acquitted.
