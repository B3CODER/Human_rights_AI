Case Title: Swati Priyadarshini vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh
Date: 22 August 2024
Judges: Ahsanuddin Amanullah, J.

Background:

Swati Priyadarshini, the appellant, was appointed as an Assistant Project Coordinator (APC) under the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) on a contract basis.
She raised concerns about misconduct at a hostel run by a non-governmental organization, leading to an investigation and subsequent termination of the MoU with the NGO.
After being appointed in-charge of the hostel, she was later removed from this charge and issued several show-cause notices alleging various misconducts.
The appellant contended that these charges were pretexts to remove her due to her whistleblowing activities.
Legal Proceedings:

The appellant filed a Writ Petition challenging the non-renewal of her contract.
The Single Judge of the High Court ruled in her favor, stating that the termination orders were stigmatic and required a proper inquiry.
The Division Bench of the High Court overturned this decision, leading the appellant to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court's Decision:

Granting Leave: The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal.
Review of Lower Court Decision:
The Supreme Court reviewed the legality of the termination and found that the respondents failed to comply with procedural safeguards required for such a decision.
The Court noted that the appellant was not given a fair opportunity to defend herself against the charges, which amounted to a violation of her rights under Article 311 of the Constitution.
Ruling:
The Impugned Judgment of the Division Bench was quashed.
The judgment of the Single Judge dated 20.06.2017 was revived with modifications:
The appellant was entitled to all consequential benefits, including notional continuation in service.
Back wages were restricted to 50%.
The respondents were barred from proceeding afresh against the appellant regarding the same issues but could take action in the future if necessary.
The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of procedural fairness and the need for a proper inquiry before taking adverse action against an employee.
Outcome:

The appeal was allowed with the modifications as described. The parties were left to bear their own costs.
