The Bombay High Court ruling in the case of Gangaram Vishwas Kajrekr vs Municipal Commissioner Pimpri on August 8, 2024, addresses several key points concerning the employment rights of contract employees with the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Here are the primary takeaways:

Background of the Dispute:

The case involves cross-petitions by the PCMC and its contract employees, challenging orders from the Industrial Court-Pune.
The Industrial Court had partly ruled in favor of the employees, mandating payment of salaries at the minimum pay scale equivalent to regular employees but denying permanency.
Contractual Employment and Wages:

The employees had initially been appointed on a contractual basis with specified terms, including non-claiming of permanency.
Despite this, the Industrial Court directed that employees be paid at least the minimum of the pay scale for similar positions held by regular employees.
Permanency and Regularization:

The Court held that completion of 240 days of service does not automatically entitle employees to permanency or regularization.
The contracts clearly stated that employees would not have a claim to permanent status.
Modification of Orders:

The Court found merit in providing wages at the minimum of the pay scale but modified the direction to restrict this benefit to the date of filing of complaints, rather than from the initial date of service.
The interim protection granted to employees would continue until the final decision on their respective complaints.
Legal Precedents and Statutory Requirements:

The ruling emphasizes that mere completion of a specified period of service does not create a right to permanency.
The Court noted that creation of new posts requires State Government sanction, and temporary appointments should not exceed six months without proper authorization.
Final Orders:

The Court dismissed the petitions seeking permanency but upheld the provision for wage payments at the minimum scale, with a modification to align benefits with the filing date of complaints.
This decision underscores the importance of adhering to contractual terms and statutory regulations governing employment, and it highlights the limits of judicial intervention in matters of employment permanency for contract workers.
