The Delhi High Court judgment in the case of Jyotirmay Nandi vs. R.K. Arora, Official Liquidator on 14 August 2024 addresses several key issues related to the claims made by Jyotirmay Nandi, a former Senior Production Manager of M/s Kapri International Private Limited, which is in liquidation. The court's main findings and decisions are as follows:

Claims Overview:

The appellant, Jyotirmay Nandi, raised several claims before the Official Liquidator (OL):

Retrenchment damages: ₹42,450
Bonus for 1998 to 1995: ₹29,715
Salary and wages: ₹22,25,977.44
Notice pay: ₹12,735
Grand Total: ₹44,69,053.75
Order of the Company Judge (29 August 2023):

Gratuity: Allowed with interest at 10% simple per annum from 8 July 1992 to 1 May 1995, and 4% thereafter until 31 August 2023.
Retrenchment Compensation: Rejected.
Bonus: Rejected.

Release of salary from May 1995: Rejected.
Notice Pay: Rejected.
Interest on Unpaid Wages/Salary: Allowed at 10% simple interest per annum until 1 May 1995, and 4% thereafter.
Background:

The company was ordered to be wound up on 1 May 1995. The OL was tasked with inviting claims starting 8 May 1995. Nandi submitted his claims, which were partially accepted and rejected. He contested the rejections and the manner of claim settlement, leading to the current appeal.
Court’s Considerations:

The principal issues were the rate of interest on gratuity and entitlement to bonus.
Interest on Gratuity: The court noted that the claim did not relate to additional interest on surplus funds held by the OL after the final dividend.
Bonus: The rejection of the bonus claim was under review.
Outcome:

The court set aside the order dated 29 August 2023 to the extent of the issues discussed and instructed the OL to re-compute the appellant’s claims in light of the court's observations.
Next Steps:

The OL is required to recompute the claim promptly, considering the court's directions.
In summary, the Delhi High Court allowed the appeal in part, specifically directing a reconsideration of interest on the gratuity claim and addressing other claims where the order was deemed incorrect or incomplete.
