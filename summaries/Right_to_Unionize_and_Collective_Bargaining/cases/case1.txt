The Bombay High Court's decision in Pimpri Chinchwad Mun. Corp. vs. Mahapalika and Parivahan Kamgar Aghadi revolves around a dispute between the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and a group of individuals who had been working under contracts for the PCMC.

Here’s a summary of the key points from the judgment:

Background:

PCMC had engaged contractors for garbage collection through a resolution passed on September 2, 1997. These contractors were paid a fixed monthly amount.
The Mahapalika and Parivahan Kamgar Aghadi (the Union) challenged this arrangement, asserting that the individuals working under these contracts were actually employees and not contractors.
Legal Proceedings:

The Union filed a complaint under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971 (MRTU & PULP Act), arguing that the contracts were sham and that the workers were effectively employees of PCMC.
PCMC contested the complaint, arguing that the Industrial Court lacked jurisdiction over such disputes and that the complaint should be dismissed.
Court’s Ruling:

Preliminary Order (22 November 2002): The Industrial Court rejected PCMC's preliminary objection regarding jurisdiction, finding the complaint maintainable. This decision was challenged by PCMC through Writ Petition No. 4931 of 2003.
Final Judgment (30 January 2023): The Industrial Court ruled that the complainants were indeed employees of PCMC, not contractors. It ordered PCMC to absorb them into service and provide arrears of wages as per the pay scale of permanent employees.
High Court’s Decision:

The High Court upheld the preliminary order and rejected PCMC's challenge against it, affirming the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court.
The final judgment was modified to state that the workers would be deemed absorbed into service with effect from August 18, 2005. However, they would not be entitled to back wages for the period prior to this date.
For deceased complainants, the court ordered processing of pensionary benefits from August 18, 2005.
Execution and Stay:

The High Court noted that no separate stay order was needed as the respondents agreed not to press for execution of the judgment for eight weeks, allowing PCMC some time to adjust.
In summary, the court found in favor of the complainants, recognizing them as employees and mandating their absorption into PCMC’s service with specific conditions regarding their wages and benefits.
