Minimum Wages Act, 1948
Background
Initiative Origin: The movement for setting minimum wages began with a resolution by Shri K. G. R. Chaudhary in 1920, advocating for Boards to determine minimum wages across various industries.

International Standards: The International Labour Conference adopted Convention No. 26 and Recommendation No. 30 in 1928, which addressed wage-fixing machinery in different trades.

Labour Investigation: A Labour Investigation Committee was appointed in 1943 to examine wages, housing, social conditions, and employment. This led to the drafting of a bill in 1945.

Legislative Action: The Minimum Wages Bill was introduced in 1946, passed, and enacted on March 15, 1948.

Key Provisions
Authorities: Both Central and State Governments are empowered to:

Notify scheduled employments.
Fix and revise minimum wages.
Scheduled Employments: The Act covers:

Part I: Non-agricultural employments.
Part II: Agricultural employments.
Notification Criteria: Employments with 1,000 or more workers can be included in the schedule, and minimum wages must be fixed.

Equal Treatment: The Act mandates equal minimum wages for male and female workers.

Norms for Wage Fixation: Based on the 1957 Indian Labour Conference recommendations, minimum wages are determined considering:

Consumption units for one earner.
Minimum food requirements.
Clothing requirements.
Housing rent.
Fuel, lighting, and miscellaneous expenses.
Methods of Fixation/Revision
Committee Method: Committees and sub-committees are set up to make recommendations for wage fixation and revision.

Notification Method: Government proposals are published in the Official Gazette for public consideration, followed by a three-month period before implementation.

Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA): To combat inflation, VDA linked to the Consumer Price Index Number for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) is included in minimum wages, revised twice a year.

Enforcement: Central and State Governments ensure compliance through inspections and penalties for non-payment or under-payment.

National Floor Level Minimum Wage: Established to standardize minimum wages across the country, initially set at Rs. 35 per day in 1996 and revised to Rs. 137 per day in 2013. It is a non-statutory measure aimed at reducing wage disparity.

Payment of Wages Act, 1936
Overview
Purpose: Regulates wage payments to workers, ensuring timely and fair compensation and addressing illegal deductions.
