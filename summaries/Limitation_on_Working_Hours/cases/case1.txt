Case Details:
Facts of the Case:

Date of Incident: August 17, 1984
Location: Millet field of Bhajan Lal, village Bhojipura, District Rampur.
Accused: Kunwar Sen
Victim: Daughter of the first informant, Kishan Lal, aged 13.
Prosecution's Case:

Allegation: Kunwar Sen allegedly abducted and raped the victim while threatening her with a knife. The incident was reportedly witnessed by Ram Swarup, Ram Das, and Bhajan Lal.
Medical Examination: Conducted by Dr. Sheela Khanna on August 21, 1984. The examination revealed no definite signs of rape, although the victim’s age was confirmed to be under 16. The examination noted the presence of old, torn hymen but no recent injury.
Trial Court’s Judgment:

The trial court acquitted Kunwar Sen of charges under Sections 366 and 376 IPC. The judgment was based on inconsistencies in the victim's testimony, lack of corroborative medical evidence, and the delay in lodging the FIR (three days).
Appeal Court’s Findings:

The appeal court noted contradictions and inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony.
The delay in lodging the FIR was not satisfactorily explained.
The prosecution's case lacked corroborative medical and forensic evidence.
Due to these factors, the appeal court upheld the trial court’s acquittal of Kunwar Sen.
The Allahabad High Court’s decision emphasizes the need for corroborative evidence to support allegations of serious offenses like rape. The inconsistencies in the victim's testimony and the absence of medical evidence contributed to the appeal court's conclusion to uphold the acquittal.
